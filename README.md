This is the term project for Yale's CPSC 475 (FA20) Computer Vision.

The project aims to detect human crowds in still images. With the assumption that crowds have some inherent repetitive visual elements, the paper proposed an algorithm that combine a bank of gabor filters and k-mean clustering to segment an image into crowd and non-crowd regions.
